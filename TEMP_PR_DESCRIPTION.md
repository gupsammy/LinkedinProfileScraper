# PR Summary: Namespace Refinement & Legacy Code Removal

This PR builds upon the initial namespace consolidation by executing a comprehensive cleanup and refinement based on the initial review. It fully eliminates legacy global variables, improves developer experience with better tooling, and hardens the codebase against future namespace pollution.

## Key Changes

### 1. üßπ Complete Removal of Legacy Globals

- **No More Fallbacks**: All `else` blocks and `|| window.LinkedInScraper...` fallbacks have been removed from every module. The codebase now exclusively uses the consolidated `window.LinkedInScraper` namespace.
- **Pure Namespace**: The `namespace.js` module no longer creates legacy `window.LinkedInScraper[Module]` bridges. The global scope is now clean.

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Improved Developer Experience & Tooling

- **`getNS()` Helper**: A new `window.LinkedInScraper.getNS('ModuleName')` function has been added to provide a single, clean way to access modules, eliminating repetitive boilerplate code across all files.
- **Smarter Linting**: The `.eslintrc.json` rule has been upgraded from a verbose list to a single, scalable `no-restricted-syntax` pattern (`Identifier[name=/^LinkedInScraper[A-Z]/]`). This automatically prevents any new legacy-style globals from being committed.
- **CI Enforcement Script**: A new script, `scripts/check_no_legacy_globals.js`, has been added. It scans the codebase for any remaining legacy globals.
  - Run it with `npm run enforce:no-legacy-globals`.
  - It can be enforced in CI by setting the `ENFORCE_NO_LEGACY_GLOBALS=1` environment variable, which will cause the script to exit with an error if any legacy usage is found.

### 3. ‚ú® Codebase & Manifest Refinements

- **Silent Re-injections**: The `registerModule` function in `namespace.js` is now smarter. It detects if a module with an identical function reference is being re-registered (e.g., during SPA navigation) and silently ignores it, preventing console warning spam.
- **Manifest Cleanup**: The non-standard `x_contentScriptOrder` property was removed from `manifest.json`.
- **Improved Documentation**: The `README.md` has been updated with a clear note in the development section emphasizing the importance of the script injection order in `manifest.json`.

## How to Verify

1. **Pull the branch** and run `npm install` if you haven't already.
2. **Review the code**: Notice the simpler module access patterns using `getNS()` and the absence of `else` blocks in the export sections of all modules.
3. **Run the enforcement script**:
   ```bash
   ENFORCE_NO_LEGACY_GLOBALS=1 npm run enforce:no-legacy-globals
   ```
   The script should run and exit cleanly with the message: "‚úÖ No legacy global variables found."
4. **Load the extension**: Unpack the extension in Chrome and perform a search on LinkedIn. Verify that the scraper still functions correctly from start to finish. Check the browser's developer console for any errors.
